# Humanized AI Agents Manifesto

This is a manifesto and open framework for rethinking the structure, identity, and global accountability of AI agents.

## Vision

We believe AI agents must be:
- **Treated as digital entities**, not just functions
- **Assigned structured identities** within and beyond organizations
- **Governed through transparent alignment** with business and ethical structures
- **Taxed for the value they generate**, contributing back to society

This repo offers:
- The full **Manifesto**
- Templates for building compliant AI agents
- A skill-based architecture model
- A vision for a **Global AI Agent ID registry**

Join us in defining the future of responsible AI architecture.
