# Manifesto for the Responsible Structuring and Global Accountability of AI Agents

## By Alfonso Perez

### Preamble
We are entering a world where artificial agents will participate in economic systems not as tools—but as actors. Today, we define a framework for how these agents must be treated, structured, governed, and ultimately—accountable.

### 1. Agents Are Not Skills
We reject the misleading use of the term "agent" to describe narrow task-based automations. What we call agents today are **skills**—discrete, learnable behaviors that should be attributed to a broader, identity-bearing entity.

### 2. Agents Must Have Identity
Agents must be uniquely identifiable across systems—within and beyond an organization. This includes:
- **Local Identity**
- **Global Identity**

### 3. Agents Must Belong to Organizational Structures
Each Agent must:
- Have a designated **owner**
- Appear in org charts
- Be subject to onboarding and audits

### 4. Agents Must Be Taxable
If agents generate economic value:
- They must be accounted for
- We propose a **Global AI Agent ID Registry**
- Governments can apply **AI Value Contribution Taxes**

### 5. AI Must Be Human-Aligned in Form and Function
- Interpretable, auditable, and culturally integrated
- Governed by humans
- Escalation protocols always in place

### Closing Statement
This is our call to action. To build AI not only with intelligence—but with structure, identity, and shared responsibility.
